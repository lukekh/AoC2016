    "# Day 13: A Maze of Twisty Little Cubicles\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part One\n",
    "\n",
    "You arrive at the first floor of this new building to discover a much less welcoming environment than the shiny atrium of the last one. Instead, you are in a maze of twisty little cubicles, all alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every location in this area is addressed by a pair of non-negative integers `(x,y)`. Each such coordinate is either a wall or an open space. You can't move diagonally. The cube maze starts at `0,0` and seems to extend infinitely toward positive `x` and `y`; negative values are invalid, as they represent a location outside the building. You are in a small waiting area at `1,1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it seems chaotic, a nearby morale-boosting poster explains, the layout is actually quite logical. You can determine whether a given `x,y` coordinate will be a wall or an open space using a simple system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find `x*x + 3*x + 2*x*y + y + y*y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add the office designer's favorite number (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the binary representation of that sum; count the number of bits that are 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of bits that are 1 is even, it's an open space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the number of bits that are 1 is odd, it's a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the office designer's favorite number were `10`, drawing walls as `#` and open spaces as `.`, the corner of the building containing `0,0` would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  0123456789\n",
    "0 .#.####.##\n",
    "1 ..#..#...#\n",
    "2 #....##...\n",
    "3 ###.#.###.\n",
    "4 .##..#..#.\n",
    "5 ..##....#.\n",
    "6 #...##.###\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose you wanted to reach `7,4`. The shortest route you could take is marked as `O`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  0123456789\n",
    "0 .#.####.##\n",
    "1 .O#..#...#\n",
    "2 #OOO.##...\n",
    "3 ###O#.###.\n",
    "4 .##OO#OO#.\n",
    "5 ..##OOO.#.\n",
    "6 #...##.###\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, reaching `7,4` would take a minimum of `11` steps (starting from your current location, `1,1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the fewest number of steps required for you to reach `31,39`?\n",
