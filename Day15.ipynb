    "# Day 14: One-Time Pad\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part One\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to communicate securely with Santa while you're on this mission, you've been using a one-time pad that you generate using a pre-agreed algorithm. Unfortunately, you've run out of keys in your one-time pad, and so you need to generate some more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate keys, you first get a stream of random data by taking the MD5 of a pre-arranged salt (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer index (starting with `0`, and represented in decimal); the resulting MD5 hash should be represented as a string of lowercase hexadecimal digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, not all of these MD5 hashes are keys, and you need `64` new keys for your one-time pad. A hash is a key only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It contains three of the same character in a row, like `777`. Only consider the first such triplet in a hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "* One of the next `1000` hashes in the stream contains that same character five times in a row, like `77777`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering future hashes for five-of-a-kind sequences does not cause those hashes to be skipped; instead, regardless of whether the current hash is a key, always resume testing for keys starting with the very next hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the pre-arranged salt is `abc`:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first index which produces a triple is `18`, because the MD5 hash of `abc18` contains `...cc38887a5...`. However, index `18` does not count as a key for your one-time pad, because none of the next thousand hashes (index `19` through index `1018`) contain `88888`.\n",
    "The next index which produces a triple is `39`; the hash of `abc39` contains `eee`. It is also the first key: one of the next thousand hashes (the one at index `816`) contains `eeeee`.\n",
    "None of the next six triples are keys, but the one after that, at index `92`, is: it contains `999` and index `200` contains `99999`.\n",
    "Eventually, index `22728` meets all of the criteria to generate the 64th key.\n",
    "So, using our example salt of `abc`, index `22728` produces the 64th key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the actual salt in your puzzle input, what index produces your 64th one-time pad key?\n",

    "Key stretching forces attackers to spend more time generating hashes. Unfortunately, it forces everyone else to spend more time, too.\n",
