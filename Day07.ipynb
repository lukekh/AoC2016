    "While snooping around the local network of EBHQ, you compile a list of IP addresses (they're IPv7, of course; IPv6 is much too limited). You'd like to figure out which IPs support TLS (transport-layer snooping).\n",
    "\n",
    "An IP supports TLS if it has an Autonomous Bridge Bypass Annotation, or ABBA. An ABBA is any four-character sequence which consists of a pair of two different characters followed by the reverse of that pair, such as `xyyx` or `abba`. However, the IP also must not have an ABBA within any hypernet sequences, which are contained by square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `abba[mnop]qrst` supports TLS (abba outside square brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `abcd[bddb]xyyx` does not support TLS (`bddb` is within square brackets, even though `xyyx` is outside square brackets).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `aaaa[qwer]tyui` does not support TLS (`aaaa` is invalid; the interior characters must be different).\n",
